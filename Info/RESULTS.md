# Results 

The final deliverables of this project are the functional code base and a written report of the project. The functional code consists of all the files in which our algorithms were implemented. It also has a human readable README file which helps locate all the code, data, and results, specific instructions on how to build and run the executable, and instructions on running the test suite with a general description of the tests. For the written part of the project, we have three files stored as MD files which are Goals, Development, and Results. For our algorithms, we have chosen to implement a DFS traversal, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and Normalized Degree Centrality algorithm. We have implemented two versions of the DFS. The first function takes in a starting airport IATA code from the user as an input (used a root) and performs a DFS traversal, while returning a vector containing all the nodes in the order the DFS was performed. The second DFS function takes in a start and an end airport in IATA format and traverses the whole graph beginning from the start until it reaches the destination. The user can call both functions, but as part of our demo we chose to call the second version of DFS since it is more appropriate to our project. The reason we chose to do a DFS Traversal is to show all the adjacent airports of a specific airport. It also has a runtime of O(V + E) which is fairly efficient for large datasets like the one we are using. The next algorithm we have implemented is Dijkstra’s algorithm which finds the shortest path between two airports by taking in a start and end airport in IATA format from the user. It is a very useful algorithm to use on large datasets since it saves travellers a lot of time and money. The beauty of Dijkstra’s algorithm is that it provides the shortest possible path between two airports among the hundreds of paths that travellers can choose from. It also has a runtime of  O ((E + V) log V). The next algorithm is the Normalized Degree Centrality which finds the connectedness (centrality) of an airport. In other words, it assigns a specific score based on how connected it is in the graph. This algorithm is also useful as it shows how well the airport acts as a transfer location and shows how busy an airport is. The runtime is O(N^4). Through this project, we made many several discoveries about the importance of graphs. They are represented using nodes and edges, which makes them easy yet efficient to work with. Another thing we realized is how even complex data structures can be represented using a graph. Upon further research on graphs, we learned social media websites like Facebook and Instagram all utilize graphs, and they are used in many other real life applications. The below demo video link contains a complete run of all our coded algorithms and proof that they are working as intended.
