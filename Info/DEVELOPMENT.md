# Development

*A document with exactly one paragraph per week, describing what was accomplished or attempted in that week. For full credit, your team must add a paragraph to this document every week (starting the week project goals are confirmed). You are strongly encouraged to as a git commit.*

**Pre-project Planning:**
We started initial research on possible algorithms and datasets. Based on group interest, we decided to go ahead with utilizing the route and airport data made available to us. Additionally, we have made a collection of links to research and project info to ensure we adequately meet the project demands.

**Week 1 (11 April 2021 - 17 April 2021):**
This week we were all busy with class, but we officially divided up different aspects of the final project for planning purposes. Sarth and Carter will be working on implementing the DFS algorithm, Isabel and Sebastian will be working on Dijkstra's Algorithm, and we will all jointly work on implementing Normalized Degree Centrality. We're going to aim to have at least one of the algorithms completed by the mid-project check-in. Before the mid-project check-in, we will meet at least once to discuss our progress. Lastly, we have begun importing the data and processing it.

**Week 2 (18 April 2021 - 24 April 2021):**
This week we finished implementing the basic graph structure, started parsing CSV, and began Dijkstra's Algorithm. We also met with our TA for the midpoint check in and discussed our progress and clarified doubts. For the following week, Carter and Sarth will finish the graph class and also creating a graph by acquiring data from the CSV files. Isabel and Sebastian will continue working on Dijkstra's and try to get it done before the next group meeting. After next week, we will have the DFS Traversal and Normalized Degree Centrality left to complete.  

**Week 3 (25 April 2021 - 1 May 2021):**
This week we were all busy, especially with the midterm for this class, but we were able to finish the CSV parsing and create a make file. Next week, Carter and Sarth will continue working on the graph implementation, specifically setting it up after doing further research. Isabel and Sebastian made good progress on Dijkstra's Algorithm and will have it finished by the next meeting. After next week, we should only have the DFS Traversal and Normalized Degree Centrality left to complete, then we will begin writing some test cases.

**Week 4 (2 May 2021 - 8 May 2021):**
Over this past week we made substantial progress with our code base. Parsing the airport and route nodes was completed and tested thoroughly. Basic graph structure was also nearly completed alongside our DFS implementation. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm was nearly completed as well. Lastly, final research for Normalized Degree Centrality was completed and work began on that algorithm. In terms of non-technical progress, we also refined the tests and began working on our Results.md file and final presentation. The final deliverables were were discussed and require some final touches. 

**Week 5 (9 May 2021 - 12 May 2021):**
This week we finished up our final project. Upon integrating all of our algorithms together to create a final, finished product, we ran into some issues and had to adjust our approaches. First, we decided to return a vector of nodes for our DFS traversal instead of an iterator object. We also decided to change our complex algorithm from Betweenness Centrality to Normalized Degree Centrality to better match our use of an adjacency matrix in Dijkstra. Although we felt slightly rushed, our project came together nicely and we are proud of all the work we did.
