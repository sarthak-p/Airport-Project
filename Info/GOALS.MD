# Goals

## Leading Question

The purpose of this project is to investigate the shortest paths between two given airports (and possibly all the connecting airports) and identify the connectedness of a given airport. This can be used as a general search tool to find all of the possible paths from one airport to another and ultimately the shortest distance between two airports. This information will be printed to the user directly in the terminal after they are prompted to input the desired starting and ending airport codes.

## Dataset Acquisition and Processing

We will be using the airport, airline, and route data from OpenFlights.org in CSV format. We will create custom classes for airports and routes to store the data for use in the graph. Our nodes will be the airports with the edges symbolizing the specific routes that will be taken. This will ultimately result in our data being represented by a directed graph.

## Algorithms

- Depth-First Search (DFS): Create two versions of DFS. 1) Inputs: starting airport name, bool vector that keeps track of visited points, adjacency matrix, and the number of airports. Output = no output but traverses the entire graph starting from the given airport. Ideal runtime: O(V + E), where V = Vertices and E = Edges. 2) Inputs: starting and ending airport names, bool vector to keep track of visited points, adjacency matrix, and the number of airports. Output: returns a vector of strings with all possible airports between the start and destination airport. In other words, it displays all the adjacent points of a visited point. Ideal runtime: O(V + E), where V = vertices and E = Edges. 

- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Finding the shortest path between two nodes (airports). Useful for finding the shortest distance between two destinations. Input: Names of two airports, Output: Returns shortest path between those airports. Ideal runtime: O( (E + V) log V), where V = Vertices and E = Edges.

- Normalized Degree Centrality: Find the shortest path between two airports and compute a score based on the number of shortest paths that intersect it. In other words, we find the centrality of airports which tells us the importance of the airport as a transfer location. Input = Country Name, Output = Airport with highest centrality. Runtime: O(N^4), where N = Number of nodes.
