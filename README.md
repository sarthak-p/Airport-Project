# Global Flight Simulator - Shortest Path & Centrality

## spati20-carters3-carrera9-ialviar2

Our final project for CS225 parses airport and route data to create a custom graph structure for performing operations. This includes finding the shortest path between two airports using Dijkstra's Algorithm and measuring the centrality of a given airport node.
