# Team Contract

## Members: spati20-carters3-carrera9-ialviar2

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet once a week every Friday from 6:00-7:30 PM on Discord. Each member will have a chance to discuss their ideas, progress, challenges, and express any concerns they have. A mutual agreement will be reached on further proceedings to ensure timely progress. Everyone will rotate being the designated note-taker each meeting, starting with carters3, where notes will be stored in a single Google document. Additional weekly meetings will be scheduled on Discord on an ad hoc basis for pressing issues.

2. **Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through email ({carters3, spati20, ialviar2, carrera9}@illinois.edu), Discord, or GroupMe. Regular communication will also be maintained outside the group meetings.

3. **Respect:** Everyone is a team leader in this group. Our aim is to not overshadow anyone, but to pursue our goals as a group. All ideas for the project are accepted and thoroughly considered, but will be implemented only if the majority of the members agree. All decisions will be mutual.

## Colaboration

1. **Work Distribution:** At each meeting, we discuss work for the following week and ensure we stay on track. Members can choose what they would like to work on, but the workload/difficulty must remain the same for each member. It is possible to randomly assign work if nobody is willing to take it. Additionally, the note-taker of the week will also be responsible for writing one paragraph describing what was accomplished or attempted in that week in the DEVELOPMENT.MD file on Github.

2. **Time Commitment:** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If tasks take longer than expected, other team members should chime in and offer guidance.

3. **Deadlines:** Each member will try to finish their work before the official deadlines listed on the CS225 Website and unofficial deadlines decided within the group.

4. **Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts will be resolved by the team as a group. Unresolved conflicts go to *Chancellor Jones* for final verdict.
